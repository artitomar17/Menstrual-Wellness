             <h1><b><i> HORMONAL ISSUES  </i></b></h1> <br> <br> 
            <p>A hormonal disorder occurs when there's an imbalance of hormones in the body, disrupting various bodily functions. Hormones, produced by endocrine glands, regulate growth, metabolism, reproduction, and mood. When hormone levels are abnormal, it can lead to issues like irregular periods, infertility, weight gain or loss, mood swings, and fatigue. Common hormonal disorders include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, Cushing's syndrome, and diabetes. Below are the few complications which we will talk about.</p>

<div class="sec">      <h2> 1.<u> PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)</u> :</h2> <p> It is a hormonal disorder which affects women of reproductive age. It's a complex condition that affects 5-10% of women of childbearing
        age, making it one of the most common endocrine disorders among women. It can lead to certain more complications like miscarriage, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes. Hence, it's important to consider its symptoms and seek medical advice at the earliest note.</p><br>

          - Insulin resistance, leading to high blood sugar levels <br>
