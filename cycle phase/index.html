    <h1>Meet Aurora – A Journey Through Her Menstrual Cycle</h1><div class="phase">
  <h2>🌑 Menstrual Phase (Days 1–5)</h2>
  <p>Aurora wakes up feeling a bit sluggish and crampy. She knows it’s the first day of her period. She puts on her comfy clothes, warms up a hot water bottle, and spends the day journaling and doing light stretching yoga. Aurora respects her body’s need to slow down.</p>
</div>

<div class="phase">
  <h2>🌱 Follicular Phase (Days 6–13)</h2>
  <p>As the days pass, Aurora feels her energy returning. Her mind feels clear, and she’s ready to take on new projects. She starts doing creative work, joins a dance class, and eats nutrient-rich foods. She’s glowing with confidence.</p>
</div>

<div class="phase">
  <h2>🌸 Ovulation Phase (Days 14–16)</h2>
  <p>Aurora feels powerful and vibrant. Her skin glows, her social energy is high, and she feels more connected to others. She schedules important meetings and enjoys her peak energy. A healthy smoothie and a long walk make her day perfect.</p>
</div>

<div class="phase">
  <h2>🍂 Luteal Phase (Days 17–28)</h2>
  <p>As her body prepares for menstruation, Aurora notices her mood shifting. She gets more reflective and craves quiet time. She prioritizes rest, eats magnesium-rich foods, and practices gentle yoga. She listens to her body and treats herself kindly.</p>
